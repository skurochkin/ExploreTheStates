# ExploreTheStates
The Explore The States is JavaFX project, which allow users to search by states and retrive Capitals and Largest Citites of those States

## Requirements:
Java SDK 1.8

Once you build the app it will like the one above, to search Capital and Largest City of the specific state type it abriviation or full name of the state. 

Note: predictive search might give multiple results if you search by abbreviation, so the better way would be type full name of the state. If no state found, the result will not return anything.

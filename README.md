# ExploreTheStates
Explore The States is JavaFX project, which allows user to search states and retrive capitals and largest citites of those states

## Requirements:
Java SDK 1.8

Once you build the app you will be able to search Capitals and Largest Cities of the choosen state, just type abriviation or full name of the state and you will get the result 

#####Note: 
Predictive search might give you multiple results if you use abbreviation as searching parameter, I would recommend use full name of the state. If nothing found, there would be no result presented.
